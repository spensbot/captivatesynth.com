I can turn everything blue with the push of a button

I can move right and left with a single slider

And when the beats drops.

Captivate empowers musicians to compliment their sound with a visual experience that just works.

Music is dynamic, fun and intuitive. Creating a visual experience should feel just as good

Years ago, we set out to create a lighing app inspired by our favorite music software. The result is incredible, but most importantly, it's incredibly fun and easy to use.

Captivate accomplishes this with a revolutionary and intutive approach that streamlines the complexity of a DMX universe, and empowering users to add complexity when and where they need it.

It's free and open source. Go make something awesome.
