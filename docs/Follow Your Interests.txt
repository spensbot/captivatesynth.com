Follow Your Interests

This has been my motto for some time. It led me to pursue Music, Graphic Art, Programming, and Lighting.

Captivate is the incredible culmination of those interests.
I only pulled it off because I first explored each disparate interest individually.

I'm not sure where this project will go, but I'm very proud of it.
